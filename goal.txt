# 🎯 Phase-1 MVP Requirements

### Project: **College Internship Cell Exam & Progress Platform**

---

## 1. 🎓 Core Purpose

A secure, structured **exam & performance tracking system** for college internship cells.
It measures **real skill**, discourages **grind/cheat behavior**, and rewards genuine high-performers using a **Badge, Star & Prestige** hierarchy.
No AI or recruiter portal yet — this is a **fully working prototype** ready for internal demo and approval.

---

## 2. ⚙️ Core System Modules

---

### A. **Exam Engine (Central Module)**

#### 🔹 Levels per Subject

Each subject (Java, Python, DBMS, OS, JS, etc.) has **4 difficulty levels:**

* Beginner
* Intermediate
* Advanced
* Master

Each exam is tied to one subject and one difficulty level.

#### 🔹 Exam Mode Control

* The **exam mode (Strict / Lenient)** is **set by recruiters or admin** when scheduling or approving the drive.
* **Students cannot select the mode.**

| Mode        | Set By          | Default Use                   | Description                                           |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lenient** | System default  | All general or practice exams | 1 warning → then ban; allows minor tab switch grace   |
| **Strict**  | Recruiter/Admin | For official lab drives       | 0 tolerance; tab switch or fullscreen exit = auto ban |

#### 🔹 Enforcement Logic

* **Fullscreen kiosk launch** (no navigation, no exit).
* OS popup grace = **2 seconds**.
* Warning/Ban rules depend on mode.
* Auto submission on time expiry or rule breach.
* Results auto-evaluated and saved.

#### 🔹 Exam Data Logged

For every attempt:

* `exam_id`
* `subject`
* `level`
* `mode` (strict/lenient)
* `attempt_date`
* `score_percentage`
* `time_taken`
* `violations`
* `status` (Completed / Auto-Submitted / Banned)

---

### B. **Badge & Star System (Per Subject)**

Each subject has 4 distinct badges (one per level):

* **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, **Advanced**, **Master**

Each badge has **⭐0 to ⭐10** star progression.

#### 🧩 Star Progression Formula

Stars depend on:

1. **Number of valid exams completed** at that level
2. **Average score percentage**

| Stars | Exams (≥) | Avg. % (≥) |
| ----- | --------- | ---------- |
| ⭐1    | 3         | 60         |
| ⭐3    | 6         | 70         |
| ⭐5    | 10        | 80         |
| ⭐7    | 15        | 85         |
| ⭐10   | 20        | 90         |

**Rules:**

* Higher levels (Advanced, Master) require **fewer exams but higher percentages** (same thresholds, scaled).
* After ⭐10, no further star growth (capped).
* Low scorers with many attempts stay at lower stars.
* High scorers progress faster.
* Exam weighting purely within that level; independent across levels.
* Badge obtained at ⭐1 unlock.

---

### C. **Prestige Ranking System (Cross-Level Normalisation)**

Purpose: Allow fair comparison across levels.

#### Weight Table:

| Level        | Weight / Star | Max Points |
| ------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| Beginner     | 1             | 10         |
| Intermediate | 2             | 20         |
| Advanced     | 3             | 30         |
| Master       | 5             | 50         |

also fill the rest of stars like from 1 to 10 all the stars

**Prestige Formula:**

```
implement whatever feels best
```


This lets recruiters or cells easily compare a **grinder** (many beginner exams) vs a **high achiever** (few master exams).

---

### D. **Generic Milestone Badges (Soft Achievements)**

These are *non-starred*, unlocked via global participation or behavior — not tied to difficulty or subject.

| Badge                     | Requirement                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 *Exam Veteran*         | 100 total exams (any level)              |
| 🧠 *Consistent Performer* | ≥ 85% average across 20 exams            |
| 🔒 *Focus Keeper*         | 10 exams, zero violations in strict mode |
| ⚡ *Quick Learner*         | 5 exams above 90% within 10 days         |
| 🔥 *Streak Holder*        | 7-day consecutive activity               |

These reward engagement and discipline but **do not affect prestige**.

---

### E. **Exam Level System (Two-Stage Control)**

* **Stage 1 – Global Default:** All general exams = **Lenient Mode** (automatic).
* **Stage 2 – Recruiter Drives:**
  When internship drives or company tests are created, the **recruiter or admin** can flag the exam as:

  * `"strict": true` → Strict policy enforced
  * `"strict": false` → Lenient (default)

This ensures fairness and control depending on context.

---

### F. **Student Dashboard**

#### Tabs:

1. **Exam Center**

   * Lists subjects & levels.
   * Displays whether exam is currently available (and mode info).
   * General tests always lenient.

2. **Progress Overview**

   * Subject-wise badges + star count.
   * Prestige score per subject (and total).
   * Soft badges (milestones) visually separate.

3. **Exam History**

   * All attempts with filters (subject, level, date, mode).
   * Charts: score trend, average %, violations.

4. **Profile**

   * Student details (branch, year, ID).
   * Total prestige points.
   * Summary of earned badges & stars.

---

### G. **Admin / Recruiter Portal**

#### Controls:

* Add/manage subjects and question pools (per level).
* Schedule exams:

  * Set **mode** (strict / lenient).
  * Set duration & availability window.
* Monitor live exams (status, warnings, violations).
* View analytics:

  * Student performance per level.
  * Prestige ranking board.
* Manage student accounts (approve, suspend, reset).
