##  Authentication & Authorization

### Login Flow (Unified)
1. User enters email & password at `/login`
2. Backend verifies credentials
3. Returns JWT token with user role
4. Frontend redirects based on role:
   - `student`  `/student/dashboard`
   - `admin`  `/admin/dashboard`
   - `recruiter`  `/recruiter/dashboard`

### Registration Flow
- **Students**: `/register` - Self-registration with email verification
- **Recruiters**: `/recruiter/register` - Company details required
- **Admins**: Database-only creation (no UI registration)

### Admin Creation (First Admin)
```bash
# Run this script to create the first admin
cd backend
node scripts/createAdmin.js

# Enter details when prompted:
# Email: admin@campusgrid.edu
# Password: [secure password]
# Name: Admin Name
```

### Admin Creation (By Existing Admin)
- Future feature: Admins can create other admins via UI
- For now: Use the database script
